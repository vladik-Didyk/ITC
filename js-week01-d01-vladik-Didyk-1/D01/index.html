    <h2>Exercises instructions</h2>

    <h3>1</h3>
    <p> In the JS file, fill in the function provided with one line of code that logs to the console “Hello World”.
        <br> To test this exercise run: npm run testex1
    </p>
    <h3>2</h3>
    <p> That function, should accept one parameter (do not call it x, y.. Give it a real name). 
       <br> 
        The code should print to
        the console “The number Y is bigger than 4” when the number is bigger than 4, 
        <br> 
        or “the number Y is equal to 4”
        when the number is equal to 4, 
        <br> or “the number Y is less than 4” when the number is less than 4 (where Y is the
        value of your variable). 
        <br> Change the value to your variable, and check if you get the right output every time (do
        not forget to refresh the page after you change your code). 
        <br> 
        To test this exercise run: npm run testex2</p>
    <h3>3</h3>
    <p>In the JS file, edit the function provided. 
        Use as template your previous function. 
       <br> 
        This function should accept
        two parameters instead of one, 
        where the first one is the number to be compared and the second one the one to
        compare with. 
        <br>
        You need to compare the numbers, and according to the right situation print in the console:
        <br> 'The
        number X is bigger than Y' or 'The number X is less than Y' or 'The number X is equal to Y'. 
       <br> 
       To test this exercise run: npm run testex3</p>
    <h3>4</h3>
    <p>In the JS file, edit the function provided. Use as template your previous function. Extend your code, to print
        “The modulo of X % Y is Z”, only if X is bigger than Y, and if the module to X % Y isn’t zero. It still should
        print the previous lines in case X is less than Y or X equals Y. To test this exercise run: npm run testex4</p>
    <h3>5</h3>
    <p>In D01/EX05, in the JS file, edit the function provided. Use as template your previous function. Change your code
        to have only one console.log after all of the if-else statements (hint: use a string variable, and change it
        accordingly to the logic of your code). To test this exercise run: npm run testex5</p>
    <h3>6</h3>
    <p>In D01/EX06, create a website that runs the JS attached file. In that file, edit the function provided. Use as
        template your previous function. Instead of logging a string to the console, create a h3 tag with an id of
        ‘output’, and change the text of the tag according to the logic you implemented. This exercise does not have an
        automated test. Run it in your browser, and check the results.</p>
    <h3>7</h3>
    <p>In D01/EX07, create a website that runs the JS attached file. In that file, edit the function provided. Use as
        template your previous function. Add a new function that randomize the values of your two variables, using
        Math.random(), with the range of 1 - 100. Call to that function inside the other one instead of providing two
        parameters. This exercise does not have an automated test. Run it in your browser, and check the results.</p>
